# CFA SITE

This is the official cfa site

## Getting Started

First create `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.

```bash
cp  env.template .env.local
```

and modify the `.env.local` file according to your needs.

#### Note

The default `.env` file is for the 'Publicly' visible environment variables.

Then run the development server:

```bash
pnpm  dev
```

## Debugging

Chrome DevTools debugging is enabled by default for both client-side and server-side code. See Next.js [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/debugging#debugging-with-chrome-devtools) for more information.
