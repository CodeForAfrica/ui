          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-hz33y3-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          We show what’s possible. CfA seeks to be a catalyst by lowering the political risk of experimentation through creating successful proofs of concept for liberating civic data, for building enabling technologies and for pioneering sustainable revenue models. The organisation also endeavours to lower the financial costs for technology experimentation by creating and managing ‘shared’ backbone civic technology, and availing resources for rapid innovation.
        </li>
        <li
          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-hz33y3-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          We empower citizens. Empowering citizens is central to CfA’s theory of change. Strong democracies rely on engaged citizens who have actionable information and easy-to-use channels for making their will known. CfA works primarily with citizen organisations and civic watchdogs, including the media and also supports government and social enterprises in developing their capacity to respond meaningfully to citizens and to collaborate effectively with them.
        </li>
        <li
          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-hz33y3-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          We are action-oriented. African societies are asymmetric: the balance of power rests with governments and corporate institutions, at the expense of citizens who are treated as passive recipients of consultation or services. CfA seeks to change this by focusing on actionable data and action-oriented tools that give agency to citizens.
        </li>
        <li
          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-hz33y3-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          We operate in public. CfA promotes openness in our operations and in the work of our partners. All digital tools utilised are open source, and the organisation’s information is open data. CfA actively encourages documentation, sharing and collaboration, in addition to reuse of our own tools, programmes and processes, as well as those of our partners.
        </li>
        <li
          class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-hz33y3-MuiTypography-root"
        >
          We help build ecosystems. CfA actively marshals resources to support the growth of a pan-African ecosystem of civic technologists. Whenever possible, this means reusing existing tools, standards and platforms, encouraging integration and extension. CfA operates as a pan-African federation of organisations who are active members of a global community, leveraging each other’s knowledge and resources.
