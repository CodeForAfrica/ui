mission:
  title: Code for Africa is the continent’s largest network of civic technology
    and data journalism labs, with teams in 20 countries.
  description: >-
    We build digital democracy solutions that give citizens unfettered access to
    actionable information that empowers them to make informed decisions, and
    which strengthens civic engagement for improved public governance and
    accountability. This includes building infrastructure like the continent’s
    largest open data portals at openAFRICA and sourceAFRICA, as well as
    incubating initiatives as diverse as the africanDRONE network, the PesaCheck
    fact-checking initiative and the sensors.AFRICA air quality sensor network.

guiding_principles:
  - principle:
      title: We show what’s possible
      description: CfA seeks to be a catalyst by lowering the political risk of
        experimentation through creating successful proofs of concept for
        liberating civic data, for building enabling technologies and for
        pioneering sustainable revenue models. The organisation also endeavours
        to lower the financial costs for technology experimentation by creating
        and managing ‘shared’ backbone civic technology, and availing resources
        for rapid innovation.

  - principle:
      title: We empower citizens
      description:
        Empowering citizens is central to CfA’s theory of change. Strong
        democracies rely on engaged citizens who have actionable information and
        easy-to-use channels for making their will known. CfA works primarily
        with citizen organisations and civic watchdogs, including the media and
        also support government and social enterprises in developing their
        capacity to respond meaningfully to citizens and to collaborate
        effectively with them.

  - principle:
      title: We are action-oriented
      description:
        "African societies are asymmetric: the balance of power rests with
        governments and corporate institutions, at the expense of citizens who
        are treated as passive recipients of consultation or services. CfA seeks
        to change this by focusing on actionable data and action-orientated
        tools that give agency to citizens."

        We operate in public
      description:
        CfA promotes openness in our operations and in the work of our
        partners. All digital tools utilised are open source, and the
        organisation’s information is open data. CfA actively encourages
        documentation, sharing and collaboration, in addition to reuse of our
        own tools, programmes and processes, as well as those of partners.

  - principle:
      title: We help build ecosystems
      description: CfA actively marshals resources to support the growth of a
        pan-African ecosystem of civic technologists. Whenever possible, this
        means reusing existing tools, standards and platforms, encouraging
        integration and extension. CfA operates as a pan-African federation of
        organisations who are active members of a global community, leveraging
        each other’s knowledge and resources.

      title: Partnering for excellence
      description:
        Collaboration is at the heart of what CfA does. To build digital
        democracies the organisation partners with parties aligned with CfA’s
        values and works as a catalyst that kickstarts new initiatives and
        strengthens the local ecosystem by investing in and working through
        these partnerships.
