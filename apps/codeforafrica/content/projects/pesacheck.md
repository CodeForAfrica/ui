subtitle: PesaCheck, a pioneering verification initiative, debunks misleading
  claims with full-time fact-checkers in 15 African countries.
description: >-
  <p>PesaCheck is a pioneering verification initiative that is kickstarting
  fact-checking across Africa. Initially focused on verifying the financial and
  other statistical numbers quoted by public figures in Kenya, Tanzania and
  Uganda, PesaCheck is now Africa’s largest with full-time fact-checkers in 15
  countries in both east and west Africa, as well as across the Sahel.</p>


  <p>PesaCheck fact-checks in two international languages (English and French), as well as major African languages such as Kiswahili and Amharic. Our network helps track political promises by politicians (through our Wajibisha/PromiseTracker toolkit), helps unpack budget and census data (through our PesaYetu and TaxClock platforms), and builds machine learning/artificial intelligence tools (such as DebunkBot) to help automate verification.</p>
