The Academy brings face-to-face and online training into partner newsrooms, organisations and universities across Africa, and hosts public workshops at monthly Hacks/Hackers and WanaData meet-ups. The Academy offers online courses and webinars, designed to teach just one tool or technique at a time, so participants can upgrade their skills at their own pace.
