Empowering citizens is central to CfAâ€™s theory of change. Strong democracies rely on engaged citizens who have actionable information and easy-to-use channels for making their will known. CfA works primarily with citizen organisations and civic watchdogs, including the media and also support government and social enterprises in developing their capacity to respond meaningfully to citizens and to collaborate effectively with them.
