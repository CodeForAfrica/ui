title: We show what’s possible
description: CfA seeks to be a catalyst by lowering the political risk of
  experimentation through creating successful proofs of concept for liberating
  civic data, for building enabling technologies and for pioneering sustainable
  revenue models. The organisation also endeavours to lower the financial costs
  for technology experimentation by creating and managing ‘shared’ backbone
  civic technology, and availing resources for rapid innovation.
