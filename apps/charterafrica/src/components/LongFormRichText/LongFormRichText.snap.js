      We process and manage your personal data in compliance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The following information provides an overview of how we process and manage your personal data as well as of your rights as a visitor and user of this site.
Who is responsible and who may you contact?
The responsible party is:
European Partnership for Democracy (EPD)

What personal data do we collect and why do we collect it?
We only store data when this is necessary for our objectives and when we have a legal basis for storing and processing the data. Below, you can read what type of data we collect via which channel and what we use it for.
Applications
We will store personal information that will be included by applicants in their applications. This may include names, positions and email addresses as well as other information related to the legal entity that the applications will be received from. Both parties, i.e. the applicants and EPD, have a legitimate interest in this data processing and we thus rely on this legal basis for storing such information.
Newsletter
When you sign up to our newsletter, you are asked to opt in, and provide your name and email address. This is necessary for us in order to send you our updates. We use the MailChimp system to send the newsletter to our subscribers and analyse click and open rates. This is necessary to understand our readers’ interests and thereby improve the content of the newsletter.

In this relationship, EPD is the “Data Controller” and MailChimp the “Data Processor,” in GDPR terminology. To find out more about how MailChimp manages your data, visit https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/.

You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any point without having to give a reason why.
Website analytics
When you use our website, your personal data is shared with a third-party company based outside the EU called Google Analytics (owned by Google LLC), whose software we use to track and analyse how people use and interact with our website. Any data collected is stored on secure servers by EPD and Google.Quando você usa o nosso site, os seus dados pessoais são compartilhados com uma empresa terceirizada, com sede fora da UE, chamada Google Analytics ( propriedade do Google LLC), cujo software usamos para rastrear e analisar como as pessoas usam e interagem com o nosso site. Todos os dados colectados são armazenados em servidores seguros pela EPD e Google.

Google Analytics is compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which means they are certified to receive data from EPD. In this relationship, EPD is deemed the ‘Data Controller’ and Google Analytics the ‘Data Processor’. To find out more about how Google manages data, visit www.google.com/privacy.
