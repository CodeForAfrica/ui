              The project was focused on helping journalists at Kenyan community-based radio stations adopt data-driven digital journalism tools and techniques to improve their evidence-driven analysis and multimedia reporting on development issues. The data portal was built to help them explore, visualise and interpret development data that impacted their own communities.
