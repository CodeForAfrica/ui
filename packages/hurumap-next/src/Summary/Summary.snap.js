              The project was focused on helping journalists at Kenyan community-based radio stations adopt data-driven digital journalism tools and techniques to improve their evidence-driven analysis and multimedia reporting on development issues. The data portal was built to help them explore, visualise and interpret development data that impacted their own communities.

The selected community radios are all an integral part of their local communities and broadcast not only in English and Kiswahili but also in various local languages (such as Kitaita, Borana, Samburu and Meru).
